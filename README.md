Police Safe Complaint App
An AI-powered anonymous complaint platform that enables citizens to report crimes safely
without revealing their identity.
The app allows users to submit complaints via text or voice in local languages, while AI
automatically analyzes urgency and classifies the severity of the case. Complaints are securely
encrypted and routed directly to the nearest police authority.
With features like evidence upload, SOS emergency alerts, and anonymous tracking IDs, the
platform ensures privacy, accessibility, and faster response — especially for women, rural
citizens, and vulnerable communities.

Goal: Make crime reporting safer, easier, and fear-free for every citizen.
